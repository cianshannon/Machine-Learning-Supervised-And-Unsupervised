# Machine Learning: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

## Description

This project explores fundamental techniques of machine learning, focusing on both supervised and unsupervised learning methods. It includes a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates various algorithms applied to a dataset provided in `inpFle_BCCP.csv`. The dataset is a bank dataset that stores information on their customers such as gender, age and estimated salary. With the dataset some techniques such as K-means and Decision Trees will be utilised to get a better understanding of the data.
